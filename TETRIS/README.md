# TETRIS GAME!

**wxWidgets** is a C++ framework that lets developers create applications for Windows, macOS, Linux and other platforms with a single code base. We have used this technology to make a Graphical user Interface for our **Tetris** game which is coded in C++. In this Project, we have used various concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).


## Files :

We have 8 files:
1) main.h
2) main.cpp
3) shape.h
4) shape.cpp
5) Tetris.h
6) Tetris.cpp
7) Board.h
8) Board.cpp
## Setup Required to run the code :

1) Download **visual studio** with C++ Desktop extension
2) Setup the Visual Studio Environment
3) Download the **wxWidgets** framework
4) Setup the wxWidgets framework using build option in Visual Studio
5) Set the Visual Studio environment according to the wxWidget settings as given in the documentation on wxWidgets website.
6) Download the **.zip** file from this **github repository** and  paste the codes in the already set environment in the visual studio.
